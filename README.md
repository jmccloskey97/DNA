# DNA
A simulation and simplification of the chemical process of cutting or splicing a DNA molecule. Simultaenously provides an example of the utility of linked lists in implementing a data structure. 

NOTE: Some starter code was provided by the Duke Universty Computer Science Department. I myself designed and created a class LinkStrand that implemented the IDnaStrand interface. The author for each class is indicated in comments, so refer there if you are unclear.
